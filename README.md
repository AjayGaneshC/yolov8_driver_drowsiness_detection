*The yolo v8 is a state of the art computer vision algorithm for object detection purpose*

The YOLOv8 Driver Drowsiness Detection model is an innovative solution for real-time monitoring of driver alertness and detection of potential drowsiness using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) object detection model. Developed to enhance road safety, this application utilizes cutting-edge computer vision techniques to analyze video streams from in-vehicle cameras and identify signs of driver fatigue or drowsiness.
